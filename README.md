# Next - Remix Meta Examples

This is a simple demo to show how [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Remix](https://remix.run/) support [meta tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta).

## How do I run this?

Go into either [next-meta](./next-meta/) or [remix-meta](./remix-meta/) and run `npm run dev:tunnel` to start the dev app as well as ngrok to tunnel the localhost to a public url

**Note: you can find instructions for setting up ngrok below**

Feel free to use an Open Graph/Meta tag preview site you prefer. I find [opengraph.xyz](https://www.opengraph.xyz/) to be be very easy to use.

## ngrok

Both examples use [negrok](https://ngrok.com/). It's very [easy to setup](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started), though does require creating a [free account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).
